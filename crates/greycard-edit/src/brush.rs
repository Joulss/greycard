//! Brush strokes and the raster they paint. A stroke is a run of
//! points in the masks' units with a size, a feather and a flow,
//! adding to the mask under it, taking from it, or erasing what the
//! brush did there. The strokes are what the sidecar keeps; the raster
//! is made from them, the same way on both paths, at a fixed width, so
//! a painted mask is one thing at any export size. While a stroke is
//! under way only its new points are stamped.
//!
//! A brush is a map on the mask before it, texel by texel: each stroke
//! sends the mask `m` under it to `m + k(1 - m)` (Add) or `m(1 - k)`
//! (Subtract), `k` its coverage times its flow, and an erase moves the
//! map back toward leaving `m` alone. Any run of those is
//! `m(1 - p - c) + p` for two planes, the paint `p` and the cut `c`,
//! which is what the raster keeps. The paint is what one plane held
//! before there was a cut, to the bit, so a brush joined by its mode
//! as any shape is reads its paint alone.
