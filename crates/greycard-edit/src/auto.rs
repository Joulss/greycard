//! Auto: the Light section's exposure and its four tone sliders set
//! from the frame's own statistics, as a starting point the user then
//! drags from.
//!
//! It reads a luminance histogram of the developed scene before any
//! exposure, the display curve or the tone shifts (linear Rec.2020 Y,
//! in stops over mid grey) and sets Exposure, Highlights, Shadows,
//! Whites and Blacks. Nothing else: not the contrast, the color or the
//! white balance. The same histogram gives the same numbers, to the
//! bit, so a second press changes nothing.
//!
//! A merge of ours keeps range over its reference's clip: stored that
//! many stops under, and brightened by as much in the develop
//! ([`Headroom`]). Auto reads it as the develop shows it, its
//! headroom on, and reads its kept range over display white as
//! Highlights pulls it in the finish, so it lands where its
//! reference's Auto does and leaves the kept range to Highlights.
//!
//! The finish's arithmetic it aims through (where display white sits,
//! how far the whites' power reaches, what the black point crushes)
//! is `greycard-render`'s `finish.rs`; the few numbers it needs from
//! there are copied here as constants, and a test there holds them to
//! what they name.
