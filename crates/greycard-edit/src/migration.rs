/// becomes `noise.profiled`; the section's switch is on.
///
/// Version 3 is the tone equalizer and the white point. No field moved
/// and none is renamed, so the migration is the identity, but the bump
/// is not ceremony: `light.tone.highlights`, `.shadows` and `.whites`
/// changed meaning. The first two were stops of shift read from the
/// pixel's own luminance, over ramps placed at 0..3 and -3..0 stops
/// over mid grey; they are read from a smoothed luminance now — a
/// region's, not a pixel's — over 0..2.5 and -3..0. Whites was a third
/// such shift over 2..5 stops and is a white point pivoted at mid grey,
/// a global power on the top of the scale. A sidecar written before
/// this build opens with its numbers unchanged and its picture does
/// move: most of all where whites was set, which used to move the clip
/// by 7 percent of a stop at minus one and moves it by 71 now.
///
/// That is the deliberate choice, and the alternative was considered.
/// Scaling the old numbers to reproduce the old picture would need a
/// whites of about a fourteenth of what is stored, which is not a
/// setting anybody chose and would carry forward the very thing the
/// roadmap called "whites do basically nothing". The stored number is
/// what the edit asked for; this is the first build that does it.
///
/// §98 moved the two ramps within version 3, highlights to -1..2.5
/// and shadows to -3.5..0, and the sliders to ±2: where the same
/// shift reaches, not what the number is, and nothing shipped in
/// between, so no bump.
///
/// Version 4 changed what [`geometry::Aspect::Original`] means. It
/// used to stand the plane up as landscape and read which way up the
/// crop went off `geometry.portrait`, which starts false, so
/// "Original" on a frame shot on end cropped it landscape; it is the
/// plane's own ratio now, and the flag turns that. The conversion
/// clears the flag on an upright plane and leaves it on a landscape
/// one, which keeps every stored edit rendering as it did but for
/// the one spelling whose rendering was the bug; and the plane is
/// the frame's developed picture turned by the edit's own quarter
/// turns, which a sidecar does not hold.
///
/// So this step cannot be done here. An edit that needs it is marked
/// [`Edit::frame_pending`] and says so through [`Edit::needs_frame`];
/// whoever knows the frame's shape finishes it with
/// [`Edit::migrate_with_frame`], and until then the edit reads,
/// renders and writes back with the mark, so nothing is lost by a
/// build that only listed a folder. Until version 8 the mark was the
/// version itself, left at 3; that ran every later step again at the
/// next read, which version 8's step cannot take, so a build from now
/// writes the mark and its own version.
///
/// Version 5 is the sidecar's versions ([`Sidecar::versions`]).
/// Nothing in an edit moved or changed meaning, so the step is the
/// identity; the bump is there so that a build from before versions,
/// which would read version 0 and drop the rest at its next save,
/// refuses the sidecar whole instead.
///
/// Version 6 is the baseline per body ([`baseline`]): the exposure's
/// zero is the body's own baseline, where it was 0.8 stops for every
/// body. An edit written before that develops anything keeps the
/// number it was made against, as [`Light::baseline`], so its picture
/// is the one it was; an edit that develops nothing is the default and
/// takes its body's. A build from before would drop the field and
/// brighten or darken the picture, so it refuses the sidecar instead.
///
/// Version 8 is one brush row: a brush's Subtract takes from the mask
/// under it, where it took from the brush's own paint and nothing
/// else ([`brush`]). An edit written before keeps its picture: on a
/// brush joined by anything but a plain Subtract, its Subtract strokes
/// become [`Op::Lift`], which is what they did; a brush joined by
/// Subtract and not inverted (a "− Brush") becomes a brush joined by
/// Add whose Add strokes are Subtract and whose Subtract strokes are
/// Lift, so it cuts what its paint cut, by as much. The first day's
/// `erase: true` on a stroke is a Subtract before either. A build from
/// before would read a Subtract as a lift, so it refuses the sidecar.
///

///
/// Two shapes serde would take are refused before any step, since
/// neither writes back as it reads (both found by fuzzing). An edit
/// that is not an object: serde takes a list of a struct's fields in
/// their order too, so `[0]` would read as a version 0 edit that no
