//! The baseline: the stops a raw is brightened by before its own
//! exposure, per body.
//!
//! The Exposure slider's zero is the default develop, and the default
//! develop of a raw is the scene brightened by its body's baseline
//! (the finish adds it where the exposure turns into a gain). One
//! number served every body until the default develop was measured
//! against each camera's own JPEG over a library (`greycard-ui
//! --measure-baseline`): the bodies differ, and a body whose median
//! sits apart from the bodies the Lightroom comparisons found right at
//! [`DEFAULT`] by more than a body's own spread gets its own number
//! here. This is the structure of Adobe's `BaselineExposure`, one
//! number a body.
//!
//! An edit written before the bodies had numbers of their own was made
//! against [`BEFORE_BODIES`] whatever its body, and keeps it
//! ([`crate::Light::baseline`], set by [`crate::migrate`]), so a
//! picture someone finished does not move under them.
//!
//! A DNG's own `BaselineExposure` is carried on the frame and not yet
//! applied: [`for_frame`] gives every frame its body's number. The tag
//! is additive on Adobe's scale, and the numbers here were fitted
//! against Lightroom renders that already carried Adobe's own baseline
//! for the reference bodies. So the rule to come is a neutral (these
//! numbers less Adobe's baseline for those bodies) plus the file's
//! tag; putting the tag in place of [`DEFAULT`] would open a DNG that
//! Adobe's converter made from a Canon raw about half a stop darker
//! than the raw itself. What has to be measured first: one
//! Adobe-converted DNG of a reference body (an R5 Mark II or an R6
//! Mark II), its `BaselineExposure` read, which is the neutral's
//! offset. Until then a phone's DNG, whose tag says its burst is
//! stored dark, opens darker than the phone's picture; and once the
//! rule is in, the Lightroom import's exposure conversion, which goes
//! by [`for_body`], is off for a DNG by the same difference. A DCP's
//! `BaselineExposureOffset`, which the specification adds on top of
//! the file's tag, is read and not applied either; it comes after.
