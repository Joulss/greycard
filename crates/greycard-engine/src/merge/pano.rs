//! The panorama: frames turned about the lens, walked one at a time to
//! camera RGB through the stage list (`Purpose::MergeInput`, the lens's
//! vignetting in camera space), placed on one canvas by the core's
//! `merge::pano`, cut by its `seam`, blended by its `blend`, and
//! written as a linear DNG beside the first source.
//!
//! Two passes over the frames. The first walks each: its luminance,
//! corrected for the lens's distortion, at half and a quarter of the
//! size; its corners; a reduced copy for the exposure and the seams;
//! and its samples, spilled to the hidden folder that holds the
//! output's name while the merge runs, since where a frame lands is
//! not known until every frame has been placed.
//! Each frame is matched with the ones walked before it that may share
//! a view (its neighbors in the order given, two away, and the last
//! with the first), each pair refined by the homography fit. The frames
//! are then placed, all at once, and the canvas, the gains, the seams,
//! and the crop are settled on the reduced copies. The second pass
//! reads each frame back, resamples it once onto the canvas (the lens's
//! distortion, the turn, and the projection in one map), and adds it
//! to the canvas's bands. Held at once: the bands, one frame, and the
//! reduced copies.
//!
//! The command line's `greycard merge pano` and the window's Merge to
//! Panorama both run [`pano`].
