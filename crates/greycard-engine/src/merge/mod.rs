//! The tripod HDR merge: a bracket's frames walked one at a time to
//! camera RGB through the stage list (`Purpose::MergeInput`), merged
//! by the core's `merge` as they come, and written as a linear DNG
//! beside the first source.
//!
//! The reference (the middle exposure, unless asked) is walked first
//! and stays, and its CA fit corrects every frame; every other frame
//! is walked, checked for movement, measured against the reference
//! for its exposure, added to the sums, and let go. The darkest frame
//! comes last, walked with its highlights reconstructed, so that where
//! every frame clipped its value stands. What is held at once is the
//! reference, its CA fit, one frame, and the sums, whatever the count.
//!
//! The command line's `greycard merge hdr` and the window's Merge to
//! HDR both run [`hdr`]; neither has a merge of its own. The panorama
//! is [`pano`]'s.
