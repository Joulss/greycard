//! The develop below the window: one list of stages for every develop
//! of an edit, derived from the edit and what the develop is for
//! (`stages`), the walk that runs it and keeps what it passes for the
//! next (`walk`), the one finish both ends read (`finish`), and the
//! worker that takes the window's jobs and runs them (`worker`), with
//! what it holds: the reduced develop, the thumbnail pool, the
//! previews, the edit's pictures, the models, and the export queue.
//! Over the export's develop of a frame not open, the camera match's
//! runner (`camera_match`) and the measurements of it and of the
//! Lightroom import (`match_compare`, `measure_baseline`,
//! `measure_crop`, `measure_lightroom`, and `fit_lightroom`).
//!
//! It stands between the render crate and the window, and depends on
//! core, edit, edit-io, render, gpu, ai, lens, match, and the library
//! alone: never on the window, Slint, or anything that names a
//! window's state. The GPU is lent to it as an optional context by
//! whoever owns a device, never made here; without one, every stage
//! runs on the CPU.
