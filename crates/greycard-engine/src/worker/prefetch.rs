//! The neighbors' bases, made while the worker has nothing else to do
//! and put on the shelf, so a step to the next frame or the one before
//! finds its base made.
//!
//! The window says, with each open, which frames are around the frame
//! opened and which way the strip is being walked: the nearest ahead,
//! the one behind, then two more ahead, under the filter and the sort
//! the strip shows, each with the edit, the turn, and the seed an open
//! of it would send ([`Neighbor`]). The shelf's room says how many of
//! them are made ([`depth`]). Once that open's develop has landed, the
//! frame is still open in the editor, nothing is queued, no save waits
//! on a develop, no reduced develop is in hand, and the window has been
//! quiet for [`QUIET`], the worker decodes one neighbor and makes its
//! base as an open would, and shelves it as a base left behind is
//! shelved ([`Shelf::put`]): same key, same budget, the least recently
//! left going first. One neighbor at a time, so no more than one frame is
//! decoded beyond the open one.
//!
//! The engine cannot stop inside a stage, so the prefetch asks between
//! them (after the decode, the prepare, the demosaic, and the finish)
//! whether anything has been asked for since, and gives way when it
//! has: the request then waits for one stage at most. The one request
//! it does not give way to is the open of the very frame it is making,
//! which the rest of the base serves sooner than a base begun again.
