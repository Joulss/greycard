//! Collections, smart collections, and stacks carried beside their
//! frames, so a set gathered on one machine reaches another through an
//! archive or a backup, as the sidecars do.
//!
//! The files beside the library stay the source on each machine
//! (`collections`, `stacks`). Every save of one is also written, whole,
//! into `.greycard/sets/` of the folders it touches: a collection into
//! each folder one of its frames is in, a stack into its one folder, a
//! smart collection into the folder it looks under, or into the top of
//! every root when it looks under all of them; and each of those into
//! the folder it was backed up to. A copy is the machine's file in the
//! same shape, `<id>.json`, `<id>.smart.json`, or `<id>.stack.json`,
//! with a member in that folder kept by its file name alone, so it
//! reads the same wherever the folder is mounted; a member elsewhere
//! keeps the path it had on the machine that wrote it, as a hint. A
//! smart collection's folder is written `.`, the folder the copy is
//! in. Whether a stack is open is each machine's own, and not carried.
//!
//! Each carries a [`Lineage`]: its revisions, each the hash of the one
//! before and of what it holds (never where: the hints and the open are
//! left out of a collection's), so two copies tell which has seen the
//! other, as a sidecar's revisions do. A copy the other has seen is
//! behind, and the other wins whatever the clocks say. Two that went
//! their own ways are a conflict: the one written later keeps the id,
//! and the other is kept beside it as "<name> (on <host>)" under an id
//! made from the two, so both machines make the same pair ([`join`]).
//! A stack is an order and a top, whole, and keeps the later alone.
//! Deleting one leaves `<id>.gone.json` with its lineage, which takes
//! the copies it has seen and no copy edited since.
//!
//! A copy of a later shape than this build reads is left alone, never
//! taken and never written over: a smart collection holding a chip out
//! is shape 3, as its file beside the library is.
