//! Bursts: frames of one folder taken seconds apart whose previews are
//! near-identical, found so that each can be put in a stack with its
//! sharpest frame on top.
//!
//! What a frame is judged by is its look ([`Look`]), made once from the
//! camera's embedded preview (a picture's own pixels for a JPEG or a
//! TIFF) and kept in the index's `looks` table beside the frame's row:
//! a signature, the preview's grey at 16 by 16, which two frames of one
//! burst share and two pictures of different things do not; and a focus
//! score, the variance of the Laplacian over the preview's grey, which
//! is higher the sharper the frame. A look is kept with the file's
//! mtime and read back only while the row's mtime is the same, so a
//! file rewritten in place (a DNG's previews updated) is looked at
//! again, and nothing the index's pass writes has to know of it.
//!
//! [`group`] is the rule, over frames as plain values; [`bursts_in`]
//! applies it to a folder of the index, making the looks it lacks.
