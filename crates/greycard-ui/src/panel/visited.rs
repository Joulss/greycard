//! The mouse's back and forward buttons over the grid: the places the
//! browser has listed, kept as a web browser keeps the pages visited.
//!
//! A place is a folder, all the roots, or a collection. Every list the
//! browser takes lands through `recent::opened`, which hands the place
//! here ([`Visited::landed`]): a new one puts the place before it on
//! the back stack and clears the forward one, however it was opened (a
//! tile, the tree, Recently opened, Open folder). The stacks move only
//! when a place lands: a press asks for a place, and should something
//! else land first (a tile clicked meanwhile), or nothing land at all
//! (a folder emptied meanwhile), the history holds what was shown. A
//! place no longer there is dropped, and one not answering passed over
//! and kept, each with a line in the log. Each place on a stack keeps
//! the frame current when it was left, and back or forward opens it on
//! that frame when its list still has it. The history is the window's,
//! for the session.
