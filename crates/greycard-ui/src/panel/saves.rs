//! Many files' sidecars saved at once, off the window's thread: a
//! paste, a sync, or a preset over a selection, a rating over one. A
//! save syncs its file before the rename, which costs milliseconds a
//! file on a local disk and more on a share, and a few hundred of them
//! held the window for seconds.
//!
//! The window makes each save in memory (the sidecar advanced to its
//! new revision) and hands a copy of each to a thread of the batch's
//! own, which writes and syncs every file under a temporary name first
//! and then renames each into place: a file either lands whole or
//! keeps its old sidecar, whatever happens to the others. The window
//! marks the files saved (the index told, the pictures of the edit
//! kept, an archive's copy queued) when the renames are done, and
//! shows meanwhile what it showed before.
//!
//! A file saved again on the window's thread while its batch is out
//! (an undo, a rating, a second paste) takes it back from the batch
//! first ([`take_back`]): the batch then renames nothing over it, and
//! the newer save is the one on disk. A move or a delete of frames, and
//! the quit, wait for the batches out ([`finish`]).
