//! One editor a user and profile. A launch with a path, or with none,
//! first asks whether an editor of the same user and the same
//! configuration folder is running; if one answers, the launch hands
//! it the path and ends, and the running editor opens it and comes
//! forward. Otherwise the launch becomes that editor and listens. On
//! Linux and macOS the two meet at a Unix socket in the runtime folder
//! (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, when it is the user's alone), else in the cache
//! folder (`socket`); on Windows at a named pipe only the user and the
//! system may open (`pipe`). Each side checks the other is the same
//! user before a byte of the paths is trusted or sent.
//!
//! No window here: the address, the wire, the connect or bind, and a
//! listener that hands each launch to a closure. The window side opens
//! the paths (`panel::handed`).
